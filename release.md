-   Removed redundant payload structs
-   Updated outdated documentation
-   Fixed the issue that empty text defaults are not fetched correctly from metadata
    -   Depending on the context,rusqlite returns empty text as `''` or `""` from `pragma table_info`
    -   The correction canonicalizes the empty text values
